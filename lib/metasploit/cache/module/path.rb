  # Attributes
  #

  # @!attribute gem
  #   @abstract In an ActiveModel, this should be an `attr_accessor :gem`.  In an ActiveRecord, this should be a
  #     string gem column.
  #
  #   The name of the gem that is adding this module path to metasploit-framework.  For paths normally added by
  #   metasploit-framework itself, this would be `'metasploit-framework'`, while for Metasploit Pro this would be
  #   `'metasploit-pro'`.  The name used for `gem` does not have to be a gem on rubygems, it just functions as a
  #   namespace for {#name} so that projects using metasploit-framework do not need to worry about collisions on
  #   {#name} which could disrupt the cache behavior.
  #
  #   @return [String]

  # @!attribute name
  #   @abstract In an ActiveModel, this should be an `attr_accessor :name`.  In an ActiveRecord, this should be a
  #     string name column.
  #
  #   The name of the module path scoped to {#gem}.  {#gem} and {#name} uniquely identify this path, so that if
  #   {#real_path} changes, the entire cache does not need to be invalidated because the change in {#real_path}
  #   will still be tied to the same ({#gem}, {#name}) tuple.
  #
  #   @return [String]

  # @!attribute real_path
  #   @abstract In an ActiveModel, this should be an `attr_accesor :real_path`.  In an ActiveRecord, this should
  #   be a text real_path column.
  #
  #   @note Non-real paths will be converted to real paths in a before validation callback, so take care to either
  #     pass real paths or pay attention when setting {#real_path} and then changing directories before
  #     validating.
